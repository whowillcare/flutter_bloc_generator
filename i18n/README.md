## Features

This package allows you to generate all application required user based application Strings based on YAML file under lib/src
default is strings.yaml

## Getting started

Modify the YAML file and then run the build_str script to generate the right application class accordingly 

## Usage
Create an YAML file similar to the following manually, then run the build_str script, which is using dev/l18n_gen.py to generate the dart code
while at the very beginning, you actually only need to write the skeleton keys, and English values. or in Mandarin 

```yaml
Languages:
    -   locale: en_US
        name: English
        default: true
    -   locale: zh_CN
        name: Chinese
Shared:
    # we put all the shared keywords here, refer it by using $@ prefix, value can be one or an array by languages
    AppName: XSleep
    App: XSleep App
    CompanyName: XSleep Inc.
    CompanyLogo: "https://api.secure.xsleep.com/html/img/cover.png"
    CompanyLogoImgTag: "<img src='$@CompanyLogo' width='100%%' />"
    DiaryNoTitle:
    - No title
    - 无题
Strings:
### each string key will be generated as a method, name convention as string name, underscored with its format pattern like string_name_value and its value would look like "string named as $name value as $value
    HourMeasure:
    - Hours
    - 小时
    MinuteMeasure:
    - Minutes
    - 分钟
    
    Sleep:
    Set:
    Hours:
    # It's for exception, need to omit the format parameters
    toMuch:
    - "%s %s of sleep might be too much, did you want to make adjustment?"
    - "%s%s的睡眠时间是不是有点夸张了？"
    toLess:
    - "%s %s of sleep might be too less, did you want to make adjustment?"
    - "%s%s的睡眠时间是不是有点不够把？"
    Analysis:
    Color:
    -   NotEnough: "#F08080" #lightcoral
        JustRight: "#5d8aa8" # air force blue
        TooMuch: "#FF8C00" # DarkOrange
        Incomplete: "#DC143C" #Crimson
        Desc:
    -   NotEnough: You don't seem to have enough sleep!
        JustRight: You must have got a very good dream, mind to share?
        TooMuch: "You seem to have overslept!"
        Incomplete: You might have forgot to end your sleep?
    -   NotEnough: 你好象睡得太少了呀！
        JustRight: 你肯定作了个很好的梦，记得和大家分享哦？
        TooMuch: 你可能睡过头了？
        Incomplete: 你可能忘了打卡？
```

* The rest values can be generated by chatgpt or rephrase it later on.
* Generate the rest key values by copy the whole Strings content or partially (to specific keys) and add the following description to chatgpt, it will generate the YAML snippet for you, then you copy it back
```
rewrite the following YAML file, keep all the keys intact, and first value of an array is English but rephrase it, the second value of the same array to be translated in mandarin, and second value of array to be translated in traditional chinese. also please keep the YAML well formatted Strings and show the YAML in a code block:
Strings:
  Exceptions:
    Unknown_code:
      - 提供的电子邮件地址无效或格式不正确。
  ### this is th end
```
* and the output will be like:
```yaml
Strings:
    Exceptions:
      Unknown_code:
        - "The provided email address is invalid or badly formatted."
        - "提供的电子邮件地址无效或格式不正确。"
        - "提供的電子郵件地址無效或格式不正確。"
```

For translation to work on iOS you need to add supported locales to ios/Runner/Info.plist as described [here](https://docs.flutter.dev/development/accessibility-and-localization/internationalization#specifying-supportedlocales).

Example:
```xml
<key>CFBundleLocalizations</key>
<array>
<string>en</string>
<string>nb</string>
</array>
```
